      <h3>Storyline</h3>
      <p><b>Yuichi Kimura, "The Father",</b> boards a bullet train in Tokyo in search of the attacker of his son <b>Wataru.</b></p>
      <p>Meanwhile, guided by his handler <b>Maria Beetle,</b> operative <b>"Ladybug"</b> is assigned to retrieve a briefcase full of cash from the same train, replacing a sick colleague, <b>Carver.</b></p>
      <p><b>Ladybug</b> is reluctant, as his recent string of bad luck during his jobs resulted in <b>accidental deaths.</b></p>
      <p>Also on the train are two English assassin brothers codenamed <b>"Lemon" and "Tangerine",</b> who just rescued a man <b>("The Son") </b>from kidnappers and are taking him and the briefcase to his father, a Russian-born Yakuza boss called <b>"The White Death".</b></p>
